# Module Catalog — implementation status

This document tracks **what's built, what's in flight, and what's deferred** across the catalog. It complements [MODULE-CATALOG.md](MODULE-CATALOG.md), which describes the catalog's shape and is intended for navigation, not for ticket-tracking.

If you want the *what / why / how* of a module, go to [MODULE-CATALOG.md](MODULE-CATALOG.md) or [module-briefs/](module-briefs/README.md). If you want roadmap commitments and section-by-section history, go to [build-roadmap.md](build-roadmap.md). This document sits between them: a single-glance status board.

## Snapshot — 2026-05-10

- **Sections 1–40 shipped** — v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2 product surface complete.
- **180 of ~190 catalog modules implemented** across 164 workspace packages + `apps/cli`.
- **12 target shapes ship today**: cli / workflow / channel / graph / managed / pipeline / crew / research / batch / voice / browser / eval.
- **2,526 tests across ~176 test files** plus a handful of live-probe contract tests gated on env vars; all green.
- `bun run tsc -b` clean. `biome check` clean. `example-corpus` CI matrix green.

The 10 unbuilt modules are all in v1.3+ and **not on any critical path**. See [v1.3 backlog](#v13-backlog) below.

## Status markers

Catalog tables and briefs use these markers:

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Implemented and tested (has `src/` + tests + at least one consumer). |
| 🚧 | In progress (open PR). |
| *(unmarked)* | Not started. |

Unbuilt modules carry a one-character risk marker placed before the module name:

| Risk | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🔴 | Critical-path bottleneck (blocks ≥3 downstream modules or a target shape), security-sensitive surface, or substantive design unknowns. |
| 🟡 | Well-understood pattern but several non-trivial dependencies, novel-to-this-stack, or moderate blast radius if the contract changes. |
| *(no marker)* | Isolated, proven pattern with few dependents. |

Implemented (✅) and in-progress (🚧) modules have absorbed their risk and do not carry the marker. The marker is a guide for sequencing, not a blocker — a 🟡 module can ship in any phase as long as its `Depends on` row is satisfied.

## v1.3 backlog

The v1.2 phase closed out the breadth + ecosystem layer (§36–§40). v1.3 covers the remaining ~10 unbuilt catalog modules across:

- **§41 — plugin SDK v2 + plugin-loader** (committed, kickoff prompt ready)
- **§42 — plugin-registry + module-marketplace-client** (committed, depends on §41)
- **§43 — mobile target shapes** (deferred indefinitely; needs Bun-on-iOS / NDK to stabilise)
- **§44 — cloud-deploy adapters** (independent / opportunistic — Render / Fly.io / Railway / Heroku)
- **§45 — long-tail breadth** (no-section backlog; per-addition PRs)

| Module(s) | Layer | Section | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plugin-sdk` v2 (extend), `plugin-loader` (new) | F5 | §41 | Public typed surface for third-party tools/channels/models/graders/target-backends + runtime activation with sandboxed import + capability gating. Reuses §31 plugin-sandbox content-isolation + §40 sigstore-style Ed25519 signature verification + §29 grader-registry plugin discovery shape. **Sequential prereq for §42.** Unblocks the entire third-party ecosystem. |
| `plugin-registry` (new), `module-marketplace-client` (new) | F5 | §42 | Extend §40 template-marketplace pattern from templates to plugins. Browse + install community-published tools/skills/channels/graders/target-emitters directly from Studio. New `crewhaus plugins {list,search,install,uninstall}` CLI subcommands. |
| `target-ios-bundle`, `target-android-bundle` | F2 | §43 | Mobile target shapes. iOS Swift Package Manager bundle wrapping the Bun-on-iOS Hermes embedding pattern; Android AAR bundle wrapping the Bun-on-Android NDK bridge. **Deferred indefinitely** until (1) Bun publishes a stable iOS embedding API, (2) Android NDK bridge ships in Bun mainline, (3) at least one external partner signs an LOI, (4) CI runners with `xcodebuild` + `gradle` are provisioned. |
| `cloud-adapter-render`, `cloud-adapter-flyio`, `cloud-adapter-railway`, `cloud-adapter-heroku` | F3 | §44 | One-click cloud-deploy adapters for dev-friendly platforms. Each ~200 LOC of platform-specific deploy-API + target-specific Dockerfile/runtime config. All four parallelisable; independent of §41–43 and of each other. T8 credential-leak guard mirrors §37 vendor exporter pattern. (`cloud-adapter-vercel` deferred — depends on a `target-vercel-functions` shape not yet in the catalog.) |
| Long-tail breadth | various | §45 | Additional sub-agent templates, MCP servers, embedder backends (Cohere v3 / Mistral Embed / Voyage v3+), vector-store backends (Lance v0.10+, Postgres+pgvector), additional channel adapters (Microsoft Teams, Mattermost, Matrix), domain-specific graders. Each is small (typically <200 LOC) and piggy-backs on shipped infrastructure. Reference §45 in any per-addition PR title; promote to a dedicated section if a cluster (3+ related additions) emerges at once. |

None of v1.3 is critical-path for any shipped target shape.

## Critical path & risk register

Cross-references the per-layer `Depends on` columns in the catalog with the build phases. This section is the single place to look up "what is the marginal cost of unblocking shape X?" — every entry below is an unbuilt module whose absence would stall a target shape, a stack, or another high-leverage module.

> **Note (2026-05):** Sections 1–40 are closed. This register documents the historical critical path that has already been consumed. The entries marked ✅ shipped in the corresponding sections; they're retained here as a record of which dependencies the project navigated. The active critical path for v1.3+ work is the [v1.3 backlog](#v13-backlog) above.

### Active v1.3 critical-path candidates

| # | Module | Layer | Candidate section | Why it matters | Direct downstream unblocked |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🔴 `plugin-sdk` v2 | F5 | §41 | Stable typed contract surface (semver-tracked) for third-party tools/channels/models/graders/target-backends. The §40 template marketplace gives users templates; §41 gives users *plugins*. Sequential prereq for §42. | `plugin-loader`, `module-marketplace-client`, third-party tool ecosystem |
| 2 | 🔴 `plugin-loader` | F5 | §41 | Runtime activation of third-party plugins with sandboxed import + capability gating. Reuses §31 plugin-sandbox content-isolation + §40 sigstore-style signature verification. | Production plugin loading, marketplace install path |
| 3 | 🟡 `module-marketplace-client` | F5 | §42 | Studio Marketplace tab for community plugins (mirroring §40 template-marketplace-client). | Community-published plugin distribution, ecosystem network effects |
| 4 | 🟡 `target-ios-bundle` | F2 | §43 | iOS Swift Package Manager bundle wrapping the Bun-on-iOS Hermes embedding. Substantial new compilation path. | Native iOS app embedding, consumer-mobile partners |
| 5 | 🟡 `target-android-bundle` | F2 | §43 | Android AAR bundle wrapping the Bun-on-Android NDK bridge. Substantial new compilation path. | Native Android app embedding, consumer-mobile partners |
| 6 | `cloud-adapter-{render,flyio,railway,heroku,vercel}` | F3 | §44 | Dev-friendly one-click deploy. Each ~200 LOC wrapping the platform's deploy API + a target-specific Dockerfile/runtime variant. | Fast onboarding for solo devs / OSS demos / weekend hacks |

### Sequencing observations (informational)

- `plugin-sdk` v2 and `plugin-loader` together unblock the entire third-party ecosystem. They're the highest-leverage v1.3 investment.
- The mobile target shapes (§43) are a deep, narrow chain: deferred until the underlying Bun runtime story matures.
- The cloud adapters (§44) are independent of each other and of the plugin SDK — they can ship opportunistically as partners or contributors materialise.

## Cross-cutting hardening notes

- **`tool-code-execution`** runs in `sandbox` with network=none / read-only-root defaults (since §18). `tool-bash` (R4) still operates at host trust level by design — it's the operator-controlled escape hatch. Any production EVAL or MGD deployment running untrusted samples should prefer `Python` / `JavaScript` / `Shell` (sandboxed) over `Bash` (host).
- **Boundary classifier** (`@crewhaus/boundary-classifier`) is the single chokepoint for untrusted content ingestion — see [Pillar 3 in CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). Every site that pulls externally-controlled content into the model's context must classify before injecting.
- **Eval-driven mutations** must patch the *spec*, not the IR — see [Pillar 2 in CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). `lower()` does destructive normalization that can't round-trip.

---

## Module count

- **Factory-level**: ~35 modules across F1–F5.
- **Runtime composable**: ~155 modules across R1–R20.
- **Total**: ~190 modules.
- **Grouped bundles**: 18 coarse aggregations (see [MODULE-CATALOG.md → Module groups](MODULE-CATALOG.md#module-groups)).
- **Shipped**: 180. **Remaining**: ~10 (all in v1.3+).
