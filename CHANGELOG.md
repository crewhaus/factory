## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Initial public release of the factory meta-harness compiler.
- Compiler pipeline (`parseSpec → lower → applyPasses → emit`) in `packages/compiler`.
- IR discriminated union covering CLI, workflow, channel, graph, managed, pipeline, crew, research, batch, voice, browser, and eval target shapes (`packages/ir`).
- Target emitters under `packages/target-*` for each IR variant.
- IR-level optimization passes in `packages/ir-passes` (e.g. redundant MCP server collapse).
- Active optimization loop: `packages/eval-runner`, `packages/prompt-optimizer`, `packages/prompt-optimizer-claude`, `packages/spec-patch`, and `packages/eval-optimizer-orchestrator`, exposed via `crewhaus optimize`.
- Security fabric via `packages/boundary-classifier` with `TrustOrigin` metadata and a content-hash LRU cache, wired into MCP, sub-agent, channel, federation, skill, compaction, and tool boundaries.
- `crewhaus doctor --philosophy-alignment` audit for the three architectural pillars.
- CLI app (`apps/cli`), VS Code extension (`packages/vscode-extension`), Helm chart (`packages/helm-chart`), and single-binary CLI build.
- Example specs and recipes in the [demos repo](https://github.com/crewhaus/demos) under `examples/` and `recipes/`.
- Module catalog and build roadmap in the standalone [docs repo](https://github.com/crewhaus/docs).
